WP Family Tree is a simple family tree generator plugin for Wordpress. Each family member have their own post within 
a "Family" category. In the family member posts you can specify birth dates, mother, father, etc. A complete family 
list can be displayed on any page with the {FAMILY-MEMBERS} tag. 

In this version 0.1 the family tree is simply a list of family members with links to parents, children and siblings. 
In future versions the family tree will be fancier.
